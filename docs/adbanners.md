# Ad Banners
---

- The only graphic formats that Blizzard clients support are
    - PCX
    - SMK
    - MNG

- These are old and therefore uncommon formats that require specific software to create and modify. PCX allows still images while SMK and MNG formats allow animated images.
- The dimensions for ad banners are **468 x 60** pixels

- It is not known how to create PCX files that will display properly in PvPGN
- Only WarCraft III supports the MNG format
